export const BLOG_TEXT = `Web development is an in-demand field even in 2025. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employment rate for web developers is expected to increase by 7% from 2024 to 2034. The web is the backbone of modern business, communication, and creativity.

As of 2025, learning to build apps and websites is a smart move for your career. As technologies evolve, the core principles of web development remain the same: structure, style, interactivity, logic, and problem-solving ability. With the right mindset and roadmap, you can go from a complete beginner to an employed or freelance web developer.

Here's how:

Is it too late to learn web development in 2025?
The answer is "No." Many people believe web development is no longer a viable career, but the truth is, it's evolving — not dying. New frameworks, cloud, no-code/low-code actually create more opportunities, not fewer. As one blog puts it, "The web will keep evolving, and you can always build a solid career if you pick the right mindset."

According to the BrainStation guide, Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is still the first step to learn web development. In other words, the foundation remains the same, but the ecosystem is richer and requires a lifetime of learning.

A Step-by-Step Roadmap

Everyone's learning path is different, but here's a foundational roadmap you can personalize as you grow.

Stage 1: Fundamentals
Start by learning HTML (building blocks of webpages), CSS (styling, layout, responsive design), and JavaScript (interactivity). These are the core foundations of any website. Without these three, you cannot claim to understand the web. At this point, you should be able to build static pages, dig into how browsers work, try small experiments, and perhaps build your own personal website. Once you can build static pages confidently, It's time to make them dynamic and interactive — this is where front-end specialization comes in.

Stage 2: Front-end specialization
Once you are comfortable with the fundamentals, dig deeper into advanced CSS (Flexbox, Grid), responsive design, and then move to a JavaScript framework like React or Vue. According to BrainStation, a front-end developer works on the viewing side of website development — the part that is displayed to users. At this point, you should be working with dynamic web pages or more complex layouts.

Front-end specialization itself is a full career path, but if you want to explore further, go to the next stage. I'd recommend following all stages to truly understand what you enjoy most and where to focus your career.

Stage 3: Back end/ full stack
You can become either a specialized back-end developer or a full-stack developer, depending on your interests. To do so, you must learn server-side development: web servers, APIs, databases, routing, templating, and authentication.

The FreeCodeCamp guide advises building full-stack applications (front-end + back-end + database) to gain real-world experience. Build projects with user accounts, data persistence, admin dashboards, and deployment to a live server.

Stage 4: Advanced topics and professional readiness
At this stage, you'll dive into advanced topics like architecture, optimization, DevOps, security, performance, large code bases, and teamwork. You will also build a strong portfolio, featuring high-quality projects that demonstrate your abilities.

According to a Medium article by James McArthur, your journey doesn't stop at learning code — you must learn how to learn, how to present yourself, build a portfolio, and how to stand out from thousands of applicants.

Focus on professional skills like version control, test-driven development, documentation, collaboration, and communication.

Is starting with WordPress a good idea?
Many newcomers ask, "Is starting with WordPress a good idea?" The answer depends on how you use it. WordPress is a fantastic starting point for beginners — it lets you build real sites fast and even earn your first income. But remember: it's a launchpad, not a destination.

Pros of starting with WordPress:
You get something live quickly, and it looks legitimate.
You'll pick up hosting/domain basics, real user workflows, plugin/theme logic.
It's relevant for clients who just need a presentable website
Many startups hire WordPress developers since it's an affordable and fast option.
Cons (If you're not careful)
If you stay only in templated website work, you may stagnate.
You won't gain deep programming skills or learn to build complex interactive apps.
To qualify for full-stack roles, you'll eventually need to move beyond WordPress.
My recommendation
Use WordPress as a launchpad — especially for your first few months, build 2–3 websites, get familiar with web-hosting workflows, and take on small freelance projects.

But don't stop there. In parallel, start learning the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS) and by your third or fourth month, transition into front-end frameworks and backend development. Treat WordPress as one tool in your toolbox, not the whole journey.

Portfolio, freelancing, and career strategy

According to BrainStation, "you'll need a portfolio of completed projects for your job search." Whether you aim to be hired or freelance, your portfolio is your credibility.

Once you've built a few projects, whether custom-coded or WordPress based, start showcasing them and exploring real opportunities. If you plan to freelance, the Upwork guide offers practical steps to help you identify your niche, build your profile, and grow sustainably.

Final Thoughts
Becoming a web developer in 2025 is absolutely worth it and more exciting than ever. Start with fundamentals, explore both front-end and back-end, and don't fear using WordPress as your first stepping stone.

What matters most is progress, consistency, and curiosity. Remember: mistakes are part of the journey. You don't need to know every step in advance. Just start, keep building, and the path will unfold.`

But I looked closer.

The truth?

Web development isn't dying. It's evolving.

And it's more in-demand than ever.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 7% growth for web developers by 2034.

Many wonder if it's a good starting point.

My take: Use it as a launchpad, not a destination.

Build a few sites, get client experience. Earn your first income.

But simultaneously, commit to deep programming fundamentals.

WordPress teaches you workflows.

HTML, CSS, JS teach you "how the web actually works."

Your journey won't stop at code.

Build a portfolio. Learn to present yourself. Stand out.

The biggest mistake is waiting for perfect clarity.

Just start. Keep building. The path unfolds.
