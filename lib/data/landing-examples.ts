export const BLOG_TEXT = `Web development is an in-demand field even in 2025. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employment rate for web developers is expected to increase by 7% from 2024 to 2034. The web is the backbone of modern business, communication, and creativity.

As of 2025, learning to build apps and websites is a smart move for your career. As technologies evolve, the core principles of web development remain the same: structure, style, interactivity, logic, and problem-solving ability. With the right mindset and roadmap, you can go from a complete beginner to an employed or freelance web developer.

Here's how:

Is it too late to learn web development in 2025?
The answer is "No." Many people believe web development is no longer a viable career, but the truth is, it's evolving — not dying. New frameworks, cloud, no-code/low-code actually create more opportunities, not fewer. As one blog puts it, "The web will keep evolving, and you can always build a solid career if you pick the right mindset."

According to the BrainStation guide, Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is still the first step to learn web development. In other words, the foundation remains the same, but the ecosystem is richer and requires a lifetime of learning.

A Step-by-Step Roadmap

Everyone's learning path is different, but here's a foundational roadmap you can personalize as you grow.

Stage 1: Fundamentals
Start by learning HTML (building blocks of webpages), CSS (styling, layout, responsive design), and JavaScript (interactivity). These are the core foundations of any website. Without these three, you cannot claim to understand the web. At this point, you should be able to build static pages, dig into how browsers work, try small experiments, and perhaps build your own personal website. Once you can build static pages confidently, It's time to make them dynamic and interactive — this is where front-end specialization comes in.

Stage 2: Front-end specialization
Once you are comfortable with the fundamentals, dig deeper into advanced CSS (Flexbox, Grid), responsive design, and then move to a JavaScript framework like React or Vue. According to BrainStation, a front-end developer works on the viewing side of website development — the part that is displayed to users. At this point, you should be working with dynamic web pages or more complex layouts.

Front-end specialization itself is a full career path, but if you want to explore further, go to the next stage. I'd recommend following all stages to truly understand what you enjoy most and where to focus your career.

Stage 3: Back end/ full stack
You can become either a specialized back-end developer or a full-stack developer, depending on your interests. To do so, you must learn server-side development: web servers, APIs, databases, routing, templating, and authentication.

The FreeCodeCamp guide advises building full-stack applications (front-end + back-end + database) to gain real-world experience. Build projects with user accounts, data persistence, admin dashboards, and deployment to a live server.

Stage 4: Advanced topics and professional readiness
At this stage, you'll dive into advanced topics like architecture, optimization, DevOps, security, performance, large code bases, and teamwork. You will also build a strong portfolio, featuring high-quality projects that demonstrate your abilities.

According to a Medium article by James McArthur, your journey doesn't stop at learning code — you must learn how to learn, how to present yourself, build a portfolio, and how to stand out from thousands of applicants.

Focus on professional skills like version control, test-driven development, documentation, collaboration, and communication.

Is starting with WordPress a good idea?
Many newcomers ask, "Is starting with WordPress a good idea?" The answer depends on how you use it. WordPress is a fantastic starting point for beginners — it lets you build real sites fast and even earn your first income. But remember: it's a launchpad, not a destination.

Pros of starting with WordPress:
You get something live quickly, and it looks legitimate.
You'll pick up hosting/domain basics, real user workflows, plugin/theme logic.
It's relevant for clients who just need a presentable website
Many startups hire WordPress developers since it's an affordable and fast option.
Cons (If you're not careful)
If you stay only in templated website work, you may stagnate.
You won't gain deep programming skills or learn to build complex interactive apps.
To qualify for full-stack roles, you'll eventually need to move beyond WordPress.
My recommendation
Use WordPress as a launchpad — especially for your first few months, build 2–3 websites, get familiar with web-hosting workflows, and take on small freelance projects.

But don't stop there. In parallel, start learning the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS) and by your third or fourth month, transition into front-end frameworks and backend development. Treat WordPress as one tool in your toolbox, not the whole journey.

Portfolio, freelancing, and career strategy

According to BrainStation, "you'll need a portfolio of completed projects for your job search." Whether you aim to be hired or freelance, your portfolio is your credibility.

Once you've built a few projects, whether custom-coded or WordPress based, start showcasing them and exploring real opportunities. If you plan to freelance, the Upwork guide offers practical steps to help you identify your niche, build your profile, and grow sustainably.

Final Thoughts
Becoming a web developer in 2025 is absolutely worth it and more exciting than ever. Start with fundamentals, explore both front-end and back-end, and don't fear using WordPress as your first stepping stone.

What matters most is progress, consistency, and curiosity. Remember: mistakes are part of the journey. You don't need to know every step in advance. Just start, keep building, and the path will unfold.`

Many think it’s too late to learn web development in 2025. But that’s just not true. With the employment rate for web developers expected to rise by 7% from 2024 to 2034, the demand is real. The key is mastering the basics—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks that every aspiring developer needs to grasp. Without them, you're essentially lost at sea.

Here's the reality: diving straight into complex frameworks without understanding the core principles can lead to confusion and frustration. You might end up just creating templates in tools like WordPress, which, while helpful, can limit your growth. The trade-off is clear: you can create something fast, but at the risk of stagnating your skills. 

Instead, start with a solid roadmap. Learn the fundamentals first, then specialize. Master advanced CSS techniques, and only then tackle front-end frameworks like React or Vue. From there, you can explore back-end development or even full-stack opportunities. 🛠️

Using WordPress? Sure, it’s a great launchpad. But don’t let it be your end goal. Build a few sites, gain some experience, then transition to real coding. This approach not only sets you up for freelance success but builds a portfolio that showcases your skills to employers.

Becoming a web developer in 2025 isn’t just possible; it’s an exciting opportunity. The path isn't always clear, but with determination and a focus on the fundamentals, you can create a fulfilling career.

Where did you go wrong?

The blank pages stared back at me, but I knew one thing for sure: the landscape is changing. Many believe that if you haven’t jumped into web development yet, it’s too late. But that’s simply not true. 

The reality is, as tech evolves, the web is still the backbone of communication and creativity. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 7% increase in web developer jobs from 2024 to 2034. This field is not dying; it’s thriving! 🚀 

So, what’s the secret sauce? It starts with mastering the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of any website. Without them, you won’t truly understand the web.

The possibilities are vast!

But here’s the kicker: many newcomers ask if starting with WordPress is a good idea. It can be! You can launch real sites quickly and even earn some income. But, don’t let it be your endpoint. It’s just a launchpad. Use it to gain experience and then transition into deeper, more complex skills.

By the end of this journey, you’ll need a solid portfolio to showcase your work. Whether you choose to freelance or land a job, having tangible projects is your credibility. 

The truth is, if you want a rewarding career in web development, just start. Don’t fear the mistakes; they’re part of the learning curve. Grab your tools, keep building, and watch your path unfold.
